This is configuration of the LibreELEC system for the multimedia system that I deployed on Raspberry Pi 5 in my 2006 Toyota Corolla as a replacement of the old radio.

LibreELEC system user configuration files such as addons, system setting etc. and personal files are placed in a partition called "storage".
This partition is available in this repo and can be used in the future to set up a new LibreELEC system while keeping my personal files and my system configuration.
